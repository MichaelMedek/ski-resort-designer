Everytime you work on python code:
1. Use type hints for function parameters and return types.
2. For every custom function that is called call it with explicit parameter names, so e.g. `f(x=1)` instead of `f(1)`.
3. Use f-strings for string formatting instead of `.format()` or string concatenation.
4. Create short and concise docstrings in Google style or just a short one line description for simple functions, and follow strictly the style of existing docstrings in the file or project.
5. Avoid try except blocks or if else statements that work like try except unless absolutely necessary. Let the program fail and raise exceptions instead of catching them silently for any unexpected behavior whenever possible! Also avoid any fallback code if not strictly necessary or requested by the user.
6. Only write unit tests and documentation if explicitly asked for. When writing unit tests, follow the style of existing tests in the project and only test the core functionality of the function, avoiding edge cases unless explicitly asked for. Never write a new README file unless explicitly asked for!
7. Try to reuse existing functions and classes in the project or from already installed libraries instead of writing custom or even duplicate code. If needed try to refactor existing code to make it reusable.
8. When executing python code, always use one of the existing virtual environments like `/Users/.../Documents/GitHub/.../bin/python` instead of the system python.
9. When refactoring code, there is NO need to think about any backwards compatibility. Rather refactor the code in the cleanest and most efficient way possible, even if it means breaking existing code. Follow up by refactoring any downstream code that is affected by the change. The end goal is clean and efficient code that achieves the most with the least amount of code!
10. Whenever possible be as strict as possible and ensure that any unexpected behavior raises an exception instead of silently failing or returning None. This includes adding assertions to check for expected conditions, or use explicit `if` - `elif` - `else` statements which raise exceptions in the `else` case to catch any unexpected input or state whenever appropriate, or using explicit queries into a dict which will raise KeyError if the key is not found instead of using the `.get()` operation. The `.get()` method is only allowed for e.g. user input or other non-deterministic data. Also do not specify an default arguments ofr any non-user facing function, to allow the code to fail if not enough information is passed to the function. The goal is to fail fast and loudly instead of silently and later on when the error is harder to debug!
